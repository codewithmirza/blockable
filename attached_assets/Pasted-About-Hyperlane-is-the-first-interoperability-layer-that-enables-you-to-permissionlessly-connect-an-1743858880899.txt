About
Hyperlane is the first interoperability layer that enables you to permissionlessly connect any blockchain, out-of-the-box. With Hyperlane you can connect your app to any chain, and easily have interchain function calls or asset transfers. Hyperlane has a modular security stack, that allows you to configure your security model, and customize the security protocol you use to fit the action of your users.

üß© Best Use of Open Intents Framework ‚∏∫ $3,000
Up to 2 teams will receive $1,500
The Open Intents Framework (OIF) is designed to make cross-chain execution seamless by enabling intent-based transactions. Instead of users having to manually bridge assets or approve multiple transactions, OIF lets them express what they want, and solvers handle execution behind the scenes.
For this category, we're looking for the best integration of OIF using Hyperlane.

üöù Best Infrastructure ‚∏∫ $3,000
This category is for building infrastructure that either enhances Hyperlane or makes use of Hyperlane's capabilities. Maybe you‚Äôll build a customized Deploy tool to bundle Hyperlane with any OP Chain deployment? Or perhaps you‚Äôd build a way to more easily connect chains with Hyperlane? Maybe you‚Äôll build a tool to allow any chain to get access to oracle feeds from any chain? You decide!
