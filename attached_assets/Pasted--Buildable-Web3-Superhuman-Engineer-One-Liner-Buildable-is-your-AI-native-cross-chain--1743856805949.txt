## Core Features

### 1. **Cross-Chain AI Developer Agents**

- **Use case:** Build AI agents that can act across multiple chains
- **Tech:** Sentient SDK + Hyperlane Open Intents Framework (OIF)
- **Benefits:** Seamless automation of smart contract deployment, testing, upgrading, and monitoring across chains like Polygon PoS, zkEVM, and HashKey

### 2. **MCP-Enabled Context Adapters**

- **Use case:** Agents that respond to real-time on-chain or off-chain data
- **Tech:** Polygon MCP, Chainlink, The Graph
- **Benefits:** Build composable developer agents that can react to user wallet balances, token swaps, GitHub events, Notion docs, etc.

### 3. **Compliant RWA Tokenization Suite**

- **Use case:** Enable users to tokenize real-world assets securely
- **Tech:** HashKey Chain + Chainlink CCIP + zk-identity attestations
- **Benefits:** Fractional ownership, secure audits, on-chain verification of property, art, invoices, etc.

### 4. **Intent-based Infrastructure Deployment**

- **Use case:** Launch infra across Polygon CDK chains and HashKey via intents
- **Tech:** Hyperlane Deploy Tool + OIF
- **Benefits:** Developers can declaratively express intents like "launch a Polygon CDK chain with an EVM-compatible DEX and bridge to HashKey"

### 5. **Web2-Style UX for Web3 Payments**

- **Use case:** Build apps with seamless onboarding
- **Tech:** Polygon Gasless TXs + Social logins + Paymaster infra
- **Benefits:** Apps like subscriptions, P2P tips, marketplace checkouts using fiat onramps feel like Venmo/CashApp

### 6. **Compliant Identity + Access Infrastructure**

- **Use case:** DID with tiered permissions and verifiable credentials
- **Tech:** HashKey Identity Layer, zkProofs
- **Benefits:** Power compliant DAOs, securities trading platforms, supply chain verification

### 7. **Composable SDK and No-Code Builder**

- **Use case:** Devs and non-devs build and deploy apps visually
- **Tech:** Buildable SDK + drag-and-drop flow builder with smart contract templates
- **Benefits:** One-click deploy on Polygon zkEVM or HashKey Chain, with Hyperlane interop
